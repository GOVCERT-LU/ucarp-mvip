ucarp-mvip (1.0~dev12) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  [ Tero Kantonen ]
  * Initial release.
  * Fixed start-stop-deamon so it writes correct pids.
  * Refactor out ifquery usage as it required 'auto' mode interfaces.
  * Make the init script bit more debian-like.
  * Don't start the carp if vip-up is unable to parse interface details.

  [ Georges Toth ]
  * make the up- and down-script configurable per VIP
  * remove hardcoded password parameter in init script in order to also support password-file
  * when searching for config files, include symlinks
