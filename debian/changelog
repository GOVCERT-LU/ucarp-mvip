ucarp-mvip (1.0~dev8) UNRELEASED; urgency=low

  * Initial release.
  * Fixed start-stop-deamon so it writes correct pids.
  * Refactor out ifquery usage as it required 'auto' mode interfaces.
  * Make the init script bit more debian-like.
  * Don't start the carp if vip-up is unable to parse interface details.
